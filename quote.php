				“Life is simple. 
                There is a time to meet and a time to leave.
                When you meet him/her, perhaps happiness and sadness have been a sign to describe him/her.
                And when he/she is going to leave, a memory is kept to remind him/her.
                So, live your life to be thankful to Him. Wherever you are, be yourself.” <span>- <a href="index.html">Edo Yonatan Koentjoro</a> -</span>
